AUVSI SUAS Setup Scripts
================================================================================

This folder contains setup scripts to automatically install dependencies for
development and deployment of the AUVSI SUAS software systems.

Change the working directory to this directory, and execute scripts:

1. ./init.sh
2. ./setup.sh

The init.sh script prepares the machine for automated setup. This includes
updating the system and installing Puppet. The setup.sh script executes the
Puppet automated setup scripts.
